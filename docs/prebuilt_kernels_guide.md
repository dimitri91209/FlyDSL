## 1. Normalization kernels

### 1.1 LayerNorm (`kernels/norm/layernorm_kernel.py`)

Computes `LayerNorm(x) = (x - mean) / sqrt(var + eps) * gamma + beta` for each row.

**Builder:**
```python
from kernels.norm.layernorm_kernel import build_layernorm_module

executor = build_layernorm_module(N=8192, dtype_str="bf16")
```

**Configuration constants:**
| Constant | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCK_THREADS` | 256 | Threads per block |
| `WARP_SIZE` | 64 on CDNA, 32 on RDNA | Wavefront size, resolved from the target arch |
| `VEC_WIDTH` | 8 | Vector load/store width |
| `EPS` | 1e-5 | Numerical stability epsilon |

**Algorithm:**
- **Two-pass normalization**: Pass 1 computes mean and variance, Pass 2 applies affine transform
- **Vectorized path**: When the element type is 16-bit and `N % VEC_WIDTH == 0`, the row is covered by `N / VEC_WIDTH` vector tiles with no scalar tail
- **Scalar path**: FP32, or any `N` not divisible by `VEC_WIDTH`, falls back to a fully scalar two-pass implementation
- **bf16 handling**: Software round-to-nearest-even (RNE) pack on gfx942; hardware `cvt_pk_bf16_f32` on gfx950+
- **Warp reduction**: XOR-shuffle-based intra-wave reduction (shifts: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), then LDS-based cross-wave synchronization

**Kernel signature:**
```python
@flyc.kernel
layernorm_kernel(Input, Gamma, Beta, Output, Mean, Rstd)

@flyc.jit
launch_layernorm(Input, Gamma, Beta, Output, m_in, stream=...)
# store_stats=True inserts Mean and Rstd before m_in
```
The builder returns the `launch_layernorm` closure. The row count `m_in` is a
runtime launch argument, not a kernel parameter.

### 1.2 RMSNorm (`kernels/norm/rmsnorm_kernel.py`)

Computes `RMSNorm(x) = x / sqrt(mean(x^2) + eps) * gamma`.

**Builder:**
```python
from kernels.norm.rmsnorm_kernel import build_rmsnorm_module

executor = build_rmsnorm_module(N=8192, dtype_str="bf16", store_rstd=False)
```

`build_rmsnorm_module(N, dtype_str, store_rstd=False, eps=EPS,
BLOCK_THREADS=None, weight_dtype_str=None)` optionally writes the
per-row reciprocal std (`rstd`) for use by the backward pass.
`weight_dtype_str` defaults to `dtype_str`; FP16/BF16 activations additionally
support FP32 weights.

**Quantized variants:** The DynamicQuant and SmoothQuant builders emit int8
`Output` and fp32 per-row `YScale`. `Input` must use the element dtype named by
the builder's `dtype_str`, and every other operand — `Gamma`, the fused-add
`ResidualIn`/`ResidualOut`, and SmoothQuant `XScale` — must match it. The
launchers raise `ValueError` on a mismatch, so a wrong dtype fails at compile
time rather than silently producing corrupted scales. Unlike the plain forward,
the quantized builders do not accept FP32 weights with FP16/BF16 activations.

**Backward:** `build_rmsnorm_bwd_module(N, dtype_str,
weight_dtype_str=None)` builds the fused RMSNorm backward kernel (grid `(M,)`,
one block per row). Kernel signature
`rmsnorm_bwd_kernel(Input, Gamma, DY, Rstd, DX, DWeight)`: reads the forward
`Rstd`, writes `DX` (input grad), and atomic-adds into `DWeight` (fp32 weight
grad). The forward bakes `eps` into `Rstd`, so the backward does not need it.
The public plain and fused-add training wrappers return `dweight` in the
original weight dtype.

**Configuration constants:**
| Constant | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCK_THREADS` | 256; 512 on gfx95x when `N >= 8192` | Resolved by `default_block_threads(N, arch)` when the builder argument is left at `None` |
| `WARP_SIZE` | 64 on CDNA, 32 on RDNA | Wavefront size, resolved from the target arch |
| `VEC_WIDTH` | 8 | Vector load/store width |
| `EPS` | 1e-5 | Numerical stability epsilon |

**Algorithm (2-pass, row cached in registers):**
1. **Pass 1**: One vectorized global read per row; the input stays in registers
   and the sum of squares is accumulated in the same pass. A scalar tail covers
   the `N % VEC_WIDTH` leftover elements.
2. **Pass 2**: Normalize, multiply by gamma, and store, reusing the registers
   from pass 1. `Gamma` is preloaded during pass 1 on the gfx942 BF16 fast path.

LDS holds only the cross-wave reduction slots, sized by the wave count rather
than by `N`; the row itself never passes through shared memory. The quantized
builders add a third pass that applies the per-row scale.

**Kernel signature:**
```python
@flyc.kernel
rmsnorm_kernel(Input, Gamma, Rstd, Output)

@flyc.jit
launch_rmsnorm(Input, Gamma, Output, m_in, stream=...)
# store_rstd=True inserts Rstd between Output and m_in
```

## 2. Softmax kernel

### 2.1 Softmax (`kernels/norm/softmax_kernel.py`)

Computes row-wise softmax: `softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i - max(x)) / sum(exp(x - max(x)))`.

**Builder:**
```python
from kernels.norm.softmax_kernel import build_softmax_module

executor = build_softmax_module(M=32768, N=8192, dtype_str="bf16")
```

**Configuration:**
| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCK_THREADS` | 256 by default; 64/128/256/512 for full-row candidates | Total threads per block |
| `THREADS_PER_ROW` | Defaults to `BLOCK_THREADS`; 8/16/32/64 for short-row candidates | Reduction subgroup assigned to one row |
| `ROWS_PER_BLOCK` | 1 by default; derived from `BLOCK_THREADS / THREADS_PER_ROW` | Independent rows packed into one block |
| `vec_width` | `128 // elem_bits` (8 for f16/bf16, 4 for f32) | Derived from the 128-bit transaction contract |
| `WARP_SIZE` | 64 on CDNA, 32 on RDNA | Wavefront size, resolved from the target arch |

`THREADS_PER_ROW` also selects the data-movement path: with
`tile_cols = THREADS_PER_ROW * vec_width`, a row takes the vectorized fast path when
`N % tile_cols == 0` and the scalar generic path otherwise.

**Opt-in autotuning** (`kernels/norm/softmax_autotune.py`):
```python
from kernels.norm.softmax_autotune import softmax_autotuned

softmax_autotuned(x, y)              # serves the tuned or default config, never searches
```
Ordinary calls follow the searched-winner cache → offline artifact → compatibility default
(`BLOCK_THREADS=256`) ordering and never benchmark. `FLYDSL_AUTOTUNE=1` forces a search over
a bounded, shape-aware space:

- full-row `BLOCK_THREADS ∈ {64,128,256,512}` ×
  `waves_per_eu ∈ {none,1,2,4}`;
- Quack-style short-row packing that decouples `THREADS_PER_ROW` from total
  block threads and processes several rows per block.

The search-space rationale was checked against AITER
`536118aaf94047b0b559e0730749352659419b34`, SGLang
`955704544c60e920672aa434cefa2ce78c0ceb4c`, and Tri Dao's Quack
`60d88082272a256fa9b3b2ab631c82cfa78337c6`. Quack's portable ideas are the
row-width-dependent reduction subgroup, a separate 128/256-thread CTA size,
multiple rows per CTA, and an online/non-online algorithm choice; its
multi-CTA cluster reduction is NVIDIA-specific. AITER's standalone Triton
kernel is a fixed two-pass online/reload implementation (`.cg`, eight warps,
two stages, `waves_per_eu=2`), not an autotuned space. The pinned SGLang tree
has attention-local and top-k softmax implementations but no directly comparable
standalone row-wise kernel; attention tile/stage choices are therefore not
imported here.

Every candidate is numerically validated before ranking and uses the shared
GPU-backlog and batched-event timer. Input cache policy is deliberately not a
search axis: on gfx950, non-temporal loads changed rank between repeated use of
one address and rotation across fresh addresses. Cache residency is absent from
the shape-only artifact identity, so persisting either result would encode an
unstated workload assumption. The tested three-pass reload algorithm is also
excluded because it lost to the register-buffered compatibility path; a future
algorithm axis should implement a true online pair reduction before entering
the default search.

Within a 2% timing tie, the selector favors the compatibility default, then no
explicit `waves_per_eu`, then more rows per block. Larger measured improvements
still win; the tie rule only avoids persisting noise-level differences between
6–10 µs candidates. Softmax uses 10 warmup and 100 measured launches, divided
into five GPU-backlogged event windows, so bandwidth-scale candidates are also
ranked from a stable sample.

Artifacts use the name `softmax_fwd` and cover forward only. Softmax backward
has no autotune adopter in this change. See [`autotune_guide.md`](autotune_guide.md).

**Algorithm (6 stages):**
1. **Load data**: Vectorized global loads into register buffer with validity masks
2. **Local max**: Per-thread vector reduction (`maxnumf`)
3. **Global max**: Block-wide shuffle reduction (intra-wave XOR → wave0 finalize via LDS)
4. **Local exp + sum**: `exp2(x * log2(e))` approximation, accumulate partial sums
5. **Global sum**: Block-wide reduction for sum
6. **Normalize + store**: Divide by sum, convert to output dtype, vectorized store

**Kernel signature:**
```python
build_softmax_module(M, N, dtype_str="f32", BLOCK_THREADS=256)  # M is vestigial
launch_softmax(A, C, m_in, stream=...)                          # returned launcher

# Direct-JIT entry point used by the autotuner
softmax_direct(A, C, m_in, N, dtype_str, BLOCK_THREADS, tuning_schema, stream=...)
```

### 2.2 Softmax backward (`kernels/norm/softmax_bwd_kernel.py`)

Computes the row-wise Softmax gradient: `dx = y * (dy - sum(dy * y))`, with the
dot reduction accumulated in fp32.

**Builder:**
```python
from kernels.norm.softmax_bwd_kernel import build_softmax_bwd_module

launch = build_softmax_bwd_module(N=8192, dtype_str="bf16")
launch(dy, y, dx, M, stream=torch.cuda.current_stream())
```

The builder takes `N` only; the row count is the runtime `m_in` launch argument.
Inputs must be **contiguous 2-D** tensors — reshape a 4-D attention gradient to
`(B*H*S, S)` before calling, since the buffer-tensor path assumes row-major rows.

**Paths:**
| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `N >= tile_cols and N % tile_cols == 0` | 128-bit vectorized load/store (`tile_cols` = 1024 for f32, 2048 for 16-bit) |
| otherwise | masked scalar path for arbitrary `N` |
| `N <= 16384` | both operands register-resident across the reduction — ideal 3-unit traffic |
| `16384 < N <= 32768` | `Y` resident, `DY` re-read — 4 units |
| `N > 32768` | neither resident — 5 units |

Ideal traffic is 3 units (read `Y`, read `DY`, write `DX`); each operand dropped
from registers adds one more. The residency cap is on elements held per thread
(`N / BLOCK_THREADS`), so the tier boundaries fall at the same `N` for every
dtype. Use `softmax_bwd_buffered_operands(N, dtype_str)` to query the tier.

Both bounds are measured on an idle gfx950, not assumed. Pushing the middle tier
out to `N = 65536` spills and costs 29% (337.4 µs vs 261.8 µs at 2048x65536
bf16); dropping the middle tier costs 30-38% on the shapes it covers (4096x32768
bf16: 169.3 µs with `Y` resident vs 220.4 µs without).

Benchmark these on an **idle** GPU. A neighbouring tenant on the same device
distorts results by 20-35%, and single-sample idleness checks miss bursty
neighbours — sample repeatedly and reject a device that is busy in any sample.

**Notes:**
- One block per row. Small `M`/`N` are launch-bound rather than bandwidth-bound;
  effective bandwidth reads as a few percent of peak there and that is expected.
- The generic path unrolls `2 * ceil(N / 256)` scalar bodies, so compile time
  grows with `N` for large non-aligned rows.

## 3. GEMM kernel

### 3.1 Preshuffle GEMM (`kernels/gemm/preshuffle_gemm.py`)

MFMA 16x16-based GEMM with B-matrix preshuffle layout: `C[M,N] = A[M,K] @ B[N,K]^T`.

Uses the `@flyc.kernel` / `@flyc.jit` API.

**Builder:**
```python
from kernels.gemm.preshuffle_gemm import compile_preshuffle_gemm

launch_fn = compile_preshuffle_gemm(
    N=5120, K=8192,
    tile_m=16, tile_n=128, tile_k=256,
    in_dtype="fp8",
    out_dtype="bf16",
    epilogue="none",
    lds_stage=2,
)
```

Returns a `@flyc.jit`-decorated function that auto-compiles on first call.

**Parameters** (keyword-only):
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `N, K` | int | GEMM dimensions: A[M,K], B[N,K], C[M,N]. M is a runtime arg, not a compile-time parameter. |
| `tile_m, tile_n, tile_k` | int | Block tile sizes |
| `in_dtype` | str | `"fp8"`, `"int8"`, `"fp16"`, `"bf16"` (default `"fp8"`) |
| `out_dtype` | str | Output dtype (default `"bf16"`) |
| `epilogue` | str | Fused epilogue: `"none"`, `"bias"`, `"bias_relu"`, `"bias_silu"`, `"bias_gelu"` (default `"none"`) |
| `lds_stage` | int | `2` = ping-pong LDS (tuned), `1` = single LDS buffer |
| `waves_per_eu` | int | Occupancy hint (None = default, 1-4 = limit occupancy) |
| `enable_scheduler` | bool | Enable the MLIR instruction scheduler (default `True`) |
| `use_async_copy` | bool | Use async DMA for A tile global-to-LDS transfer |
| `xcd_swizzle` | int | XCD remap factor for grid launch (0 = disabled) |

**Key constraints:**
- `tile_k` must be a positive divisor of `K`
- MX (block-scaled) GEMM is a separate kernel (`kernels/gemm/mxfp4_preshuffle.py`, `kernels/gemm/fp4_gemm_4wave.py`); INT4 is not supported by this kernel.

**MX A x MXFP4 B GEMM (`kernels/gemm/mxfp4_preshuffle.py`, gfx950):** the
`launch_gemm` `@flyc.jit` launcher runs `A x preshuffled MXFP4 B` with per-32
E8M0 scales, selecting the A element type via `a_dtype` (`"fp4"`, `"fp6"`, or
`"fp8"`; B is always MXFP4). This unified `launch_gemm` is the current gfx950
entry point (it replaced the earlier standalone `compile_mxfp6_gemm` from #780);
the separate `launch_gemm_a8w4_mxscale` entry point in
`kernels/gemm/gemm_a8w4_mxscale_gfx1250.py` is the distinct gfx1250 kernel.
`batch>1` runs a strided-batched GEMM over `grid.z`.
Covered by `tests/kernels/test_preshuffle_gemm.py`.

**Pipeline details:**
- **lds_stage=2 (ping-pong)**: Two LDS buffers for A tiles. Cross-tile A0 prefetch overlaps VMEM with LDS reads
- **lds_stage=1 (single)**: CK-style intrawave schedule with single LDS buffer
- **K64-byte micro-step**: Each step issues 2x K32 MFMA operations
- **XOR16 swizzle**: Byte-level swizzle on LDS to avoid bank conflicts
- **B-preshuffle**: Shape (N0, K0, KLane, NLane, KPackBytes) = (N/16, K/64, 4, 16, kpack_bytes)
- **Fused epilogue**: selected via `epilogue=` (bias add + optional relu/silu/gelu activation)

**Launch function signature:**
```python
launch_fn(arg_c, arg_a, arg_b, arg_scale_a, arg_scale_b, arg_bias, M_val, N_val, stream)
```

- `arg_c, arg_a, arg_b, arg_scale_a, arg_scale_b, arg_bias`: PyTorch tensors (auto-converted to memref). `arg_bias` is the fused epilogue bias (per-N, `out_dtype`); unused when `epilogue == "none"`.
- `M_val, N_val`: Python int (auto-converted to Int32)
- `stream`: `fx.Stream` (default stream if omitted)

---

## 3b. FlashAttention forward (`kernels/attention/flash_attn_generic.py`, `kernels/attention/flash_attn_gfx950.py`, `kernels/attention/flash_attn_fp8_gfx950.py`)

Dense FlashAttention forward. `build_flash_attn_func_module(num_heads, head_dim,
causal=..., dtype_str=..., num_kv_heads=...)` is the public builder; on
gfx950 + `head_dim == 128` it routes to the dual-wave software-pipelined fast path
(`build_flash_attn_dualwave_swp_module`), otherwise to the generic fallback.
Supports MHA and GQA/MQA (`num_kv_heads <= num_heads`), causal and non-causal,
arbitrary sequence length, and (bf16/f16) packed varlen + split-K.

### fp8 (e4m3fn) forward

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Arch / shape | gfx950 (CDNA4) only; `head_dim == 128`; dense only |
| Inputs | **pre-quantized** Q/K/V in `torch.float8_e4m3fn` (OCP e4m3fn, not fnuz); no in-kernel quantization |
| Descales | per-tensor shape-`[1]` fp32 `q_descale`, `k_descale`, `v_descale` (launch kwargs) |
| Math | QK on native `mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8`, with `q_descale*k_descale*sm_scale` on fp32 logits; fp32 online softmax; PV applies `v_descale`; **fp32 accumulation** throughout |
| Output | `bf16` only |
| Unsupported (rejected with a clear error) | fp8 split-K (`num_kv_splits > 1`) and fp8 packed varlen (`cu_seqlens`) |

The PV path dequantizes fp8 V to bf16 in-kernel and accumulates P*V in bf16, keeping
the softmax probabilities at high precision. Build/launch example:

```python
from kernels.attention.flash_attn_generic import build_flash_attn_func_module

exe = build_flash_attn_func_module(num_heads=H, head_dim=128, causal=False,
                                   dtype_str="fp8", num_kv_heads=H_kv)
# Q/K/V are e4m3fn [B,S,H,D]; O is bf16; descales are shape-[1] fp32.
exe(q_fp8.view(-1), k_fp8.view(-1), v_fp8.view(-1), o_bf16.view(-1), B, S,
    q_descale=q_descale, k_descale=k_descale, v_descale=v_descale)
```

Reproduce the fp8 correctness sweep and the FlyDSL-fp8 vs aiter-ASM-fp8 comparison:

```bash
python3 tests/kernels/test_flash_attn_fwd.py --dtype fp8 --warmup 3 --iters 3
python3 tests/kernels/test_flash_attn_fwd.py --dtype fp8 --compare --warmup 10 --iters 50
```

## 5. Kernel API comparison

### New API (GEMM)

Used by `kernels/gemm/preshuffle_gemm.py`:

```python
import flydsl.compiler as flyc
import flydsl.expr as fx
from flydsl.expr import gpu, rocdl

@flyc.kernel
def gemm_kernel(arg_c: fx.Tensor, arg_a: fx.Tensor, ...):
    tid = gpu.thread_idx.x
    # ... uses fx.*, Numeric/Vector, gpu.*, rocdl.* ...

@flyc.jit
def launch_fn(arg_c: fx.Tensor, ..., stream: fx.Stream = fx.Stream(None)):
    gemm_kernel(arg_c, ...).launch(grid=..., block=..., stream=stream)
```
